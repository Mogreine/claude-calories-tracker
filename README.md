# Claude Calories Tracker

This repository contains a simple single-page application for tracking calories via voice input. It is implemented in plain HTML and React using CDN links so it can be hosted with GitHub Pages or served from a basic Node.js server.

## Running locally / on a VPS

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Run `npm start`
3. Open `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3000` in a browser (or the port specified in the `PORT` environment variable)

The `server.js` script serves the static `index.html` so you can deploy the repository on a VPS without any additional build steps.
