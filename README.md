# Claude Calories Tracker

This repository contains a simple single-page application for tracking calories via voice input. It is implemented in plain HTML and React using CDN links so it can be hosted with GitHub Pages.

Serve `index.html` from a simple HTTP server or enable GitHub Pages on this repository to see the app in action. Opening the file directly may not load some scripts due to browser security settings.
